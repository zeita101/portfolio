          <h4><font color="#FF0040">LED Light Show!</h4>
<p><font color="#B40486">The LED Light Show was really fun today. My group made the lights switch on and off to the rhythm of 
    a song, which was really cool. However, I stil am pretty confused to how all the robotics stuff works. But I'm still learning 
    and making progress.</p>
    <h5><font color="#FF0040">The Comments Tho!!</h5>
    <p><font color="#B40486">As we all walked around looking at other groups work we had to write comments on their work. When 
    show was done, my group and I went back to our project to see all these nice comments. No one played music like we did which was cool.
        Cause you know, we are unique.</p>
