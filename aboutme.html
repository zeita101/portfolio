<p><font color="#B40486">The LED Light Show was really fun today. My group made the lights switch on and off to the rhythm of
    a song, which was really cool. However, I stil am pretty confused to how all the robotics stuff works. But I'm still learning
    and making progress.</p>
    <h5><font color="#FF0040">The Comments Tho!!</h5>
    <p><font color="#B40486">As we all walked around looking at other groups work we had to write comments on their work. When
